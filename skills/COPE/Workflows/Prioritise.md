# Prioritise Workflow

Phase 3 of C.O.P.E. — Decide what matters now.

## When to Use
- Too many options
- Everything feels urgent
- Unclear what to do first
- Resources are limited

## The Process

### Step 1: List All Options
```
What are all the possible actions/choices?
Don't filter yet — get them all out.
```

### Step 2: Apply Ranking Criteria
For each option, rate 1-5:

```
Impact: What's the upside if this succeeds?
Urgency: What's the cost of delay?
Effort: What does this require?
Risk: What could go wrong?
```

### Step 3: Use a Framework

**Eisenhower Matrix:**
|           | Urgent     | Not Urgent |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Important | Do first   | Schedule   |
| Not Important | Delegate | Eliminate |

**ICE Score:**
- Impact (1-10) × Confidence (1-10) × Ease (1-10)
- Higher score = higher priority

**Cost of Delay:**
- What's lost by waiting a week? A month?
- Urgency without importance = false urgency

### Step 4: Force Rank
```
If you could only do ONE thing, which would it be?
Now, of the remaining, which ONE?
Continue until ranked.
```

### Step 5: Identify the Clear #1
```
The single most important thing is:
...

Because:
...
```

## Output
- Ranked list of options
- Clear #1 priority with rationale
- Items explicitly deprioritized/eliminated

## Example
**Options:** Feature A, Feature B, Bug fix, Tech debt, Docs

**Ranking:**
1. Bug fix — Blocking 3 customers, 2hr fix (urgent + important)
2. Feature A — Q1 goal, 2 weeks (important, not urgent)
3. Tech debt — Slowing team down (important, can schedule)
4. Feature B — Nice to have (not important)
5. Docs — Can defer (not urgent, not important)

**Decision:** Fix the bug today, then focus on Feature A.
