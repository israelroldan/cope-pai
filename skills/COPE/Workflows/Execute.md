# Execute Workflow

Phase 4 of C.O.P.E. — Turn decisions into action.

## When to Use
- Decision is made, now need to act
- Task feels overwhelming
- Progress has stalled
- Accountability is unclear

## The Process

### Step 1: Define the Very Next Action
```
What's the smallest concrete step?

Not: "Work on project X"
But: "Open the design file and review section 3"
```

### Step 2: Assign Ownership
```
Who owns this? (exactly one person)

Owner: ...
```

### Step 3: Set a Deadline
```
When will this be done?

Deadline: ...
Checkpoint: ... (if longer than a day)
```

### Step 4: Define Done
```
How will we know it's complete?

Done when: ...
```

### Step 5: Identify Blockers
```
What could prevent progress?

Blockers:
- ...

Mitigation:
- ...
```

## Principles

**Single Owner**
Every action has exactly one owner. "We'll do it" = nobody does it.

**Concrete Next Step**
"Schedule meeting with X" not "coordinate with stakeholders"

**Time-Bound**
Has a deadline or at minimum a check-in point.

**Observable Outcome**
Can verify completion. Avoid vague "work on" language.

## Output
Action items with:
- Specific next action
- Single owner
- Deadline
- Success criteria
- Known blockers + mitigation

## Example
**Decision:** Launch feature X by end of month

**Actions:**
1. [ ] Finalize API spec — @alice — Wed EOD — Done when spec doc is approved
2. [ ] Build frontend — @bob — Next Friday — Done when PR merged
3. [ ] Write docs — @carol — Before launch — Done when published
4. [ ] QA sign-off — @dave — Day before launch — Done when test suite passes

**Blockers:**
- API spec needs product review → Schedule review for Tuesday
- QA capacity tight → Confirm with QA lead by Monday
