# Mid-Week Check Workflow

Use this workflow on Wednesday to course-correct.

## Steps

### 1. Progress Check
```
For each of the top 3:
- On track?
- Behind? Why?
- Blocked? On what?
```

### 2. Surface Blockers
```
What's emerged that wasn't expected?
- New dependencies
- Scope changes
- External factors
```

### 3. Adjust if Needed
```
Does the week's plan still make sense?
- Reprioritize if needed
- Drop or defer items
- Get help on blockers
```

## Commands
```bash
bun run WeeklyReview.ts mid             # Show check
bun run WeeklyReview.ts adjust "..."    # Log adjustment
bun run WeeklyReview.ts mid --done      # Mark complete
```

## Questions to Ask
- "What needs to change to hit the week's goals?"
- "What's blocking progress that I can unblock today?"
- "Am I working on the right things?"
