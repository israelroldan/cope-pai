# Clarify Workflow

Phase 1 of C.O.P.E. — Define the real problem.

## When to Use
- Problem feels vague or fuzzy
- Solution isn't obvious
- Multiple people have different understandings
- You've been stuck or avoiding something

## The Process

### Step 1: State the Problem
```
"The problem is..."

Write it in one sentence. If you can't, that's a signal.
```

### Step 2: Define Success
```
"This is solved when..."

What does the end state look like?
How will you know it's done?
```

### Step 3: Surface Assumptions
```
"I'm assuming that..."

What are you taking for granted?
What might not be true?
```

### Step 4: Separate Facts from Guesses
```
Facts (verified):
- ...

Guesses (unverified):
- ...
```

### Step 5: Identify the Real Question
```
"The real question is..."

Often different from the surface question.
```

## Red Flags
- Vague language ("improve", "better", "fix")
- Solution masquerading as problem
- Unstated assumptions
- Missing success criteria
- "We've always done it this way"

## Output
A clear problem statement with:
- One-sentence problem definition
- Success criteria
- Key assumptions
- The real question to answer

## Example
**Before:** "We need to improve the onboarding flow"

**After:** "New users drop off at step 3 of signup (email verification). Success = 80% completion rate. Assuming email is required. Real question: Is email verification necessary, or can we defer it?"
