# Organise Workflow

Phase 2 of C.O.P.E. — Place in context.

## When to Use
- Problem is clear but landscape is fuzzy
- Multiple stakeholders involved
- Dependencies aren't mapped
- Past attempts haven't worked

## The Process

### Step 1: Map Constraints
```
Time: What's the deadline?
Money: What's the budget?
People: Who's available?
Tech: What's possible/impossible?
Policy: What rules apply?
```

### Step 2: Identify Dependencies
```
This depends on:
- ...

This blocks:
- ...
```

### Step 3: List Stakeholders
```
Who cares about this?
- Decision makers
- Implementers
- Affected parties
- Blockers/gatekeepers
```

### Step 4: Review History
```
What's been tried before?
- What worked?
- What didn't?
- Why?
```

### Step 5: Map the Landscape
```
Related efforts:
- ...

Competing priorities:
- ...

External factors:
- ...
```

## Framework: MECE Check
- **M**utually **E**xclusive: No overlaps in categories
- **C**ollectively **E**xhaustive: Nothing missing

## Output
A context map showing:
- Hard constraints
- Dependencies (upstream and downstream)
- Key stakeholders
- Relevant history
- Related factors

## Example
**Problem:** "Launch feature X by Q1"

**Context Map:**
- Constraints: 6 weeks, 2 engineers, existing tech stack
- Depends on: API v2 (ships week 2), design approval
- Blocks: Marketing campaign, sales enablement
- Stakeholders: Product (owner), Eng (build), Sales (needs it), Legal (review)
- History: Similar feature failed in 2023 due to scope creep
- Related: Competitor launched similar last month
