# The C.O.P.E. Framework

A structured approach to decision-making and execution.

## Phase 1: Clarify

**Goal:** Define the real problem. Remove ambiguity.

### Questions to Ask
- What exactly is the problem or opportunity?
- What would success look like?
- What assumptions am I making?
- What do I actually know vs. what am I guessing?
- Who is this really for?

### Red Flags
- Vague language ("improve", "better", "fix")
- Solution masquerading as problem
- Unstated assumptions
- Missing success criteria

### Output
A clear problem statement with defined success criteria.

## Phase 2: Organise

**Goal:** Place in context. Map the landscape.

### Questions to Ask
- What are the constraints (time, money, people, tech)?
- What dependencies exist?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What's been tried before?
- What's the broader context?

### Framework: MECE Analysis
- **M**utually **E**xclusive: No overlaps
- **C**ollectively **E**xhaustive: Nothing missing

### Output
A context map showing constraints, dependencies, and stakeholders.

---

## Phase 3: Prioritise

**Goal:** Decide what matters now.

### Ranking Criteria
1. **Impact** — What's the upside if this succeeds?
2. **Urgency** — What's the cost of delay?
3. **Effort** — What does this require?
4. **Risk** — What could go wrong?

### Framework: Eisenhower Matrix
| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|--------|------------|
| **Important** | Do first | Schedule |
| **Not Important** | Delegate | Eliminate |

### Framework: ICE Score
- **I**mpact (1-10)
- **C**onfidence (1-10)
- **E**ase (1-10)
- Score = I × C × E

### Output
A ranked list with clear #1 priority.

---

## Phase 4: Execute

**Goal:** Turn decisions into action.

### Questions to Ask
- What's the very next action?
- Who owns this?
- When will it be done?
- How will we know it's done?
- What could block progress?

### Principles
- **Single owner** — Every action has exactly one owner
- **Concrete next step** — "Schedule meeting with X" not "coordinate"
- **Time-bound** — Has a deadline or checkpoint
- **Observable outcome** — Can verify completion

### Output
Action items with owners, deadlines, and success criteria.

## Using the Framework

### Full Loop
Use all four phases for:
- Major decisions
- New projects
- Complex problems
- When stuck or overwhelmed

### Quick Pass
Use abbreviated version for:
- Daily prioritization
- Small decisions
- Familiar territory

### Triggers to Invoke
- "I'm not sure what to do"
- "There are too many options"
- "I keep putting this off"
- "This feels overwhelming"
- "I need to make a decision about X"
